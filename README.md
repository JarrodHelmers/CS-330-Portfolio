# CS 330 Final Project Reflection

Reflecting on this project has provided me with a clearer understanding of my approach to software design and development, as well as how these skills align with my future goals in computer science. Below are my insights based on the key questions that guided this reflection:

---

## 1. How Do I Approach Designing Software?

**Design Approach**  
My software design approach emphasizes clarity, simplicity, and user-centered thinking. For this project, I began by analyzing the 2D reference image and breaking it down into basic shapes, which allowed me to effectively plan the 3D objects.

**New Design Skills Gained**  
This project helped me refine my skills in simplifying complex designs. I learned to reduce each object to essential low-polygon shapes, ensuring they remained recognizable while minimizing computational load.

**Design Process**  
I followed an iterative process:  
1. Sketching the scene layout and identifying basic shapes for each object.  
2. Creating each object one by one, testing and refining along the way.  
3. Ensuring all elements were cohesive in the final composition.  

**Future Applications**  
This modular design approach—focusing on smaller components individually before assembling the whole—will prove valuable in future projects. By keeping each part independent, adjustments become more manageable, allowing me to create more complex scenes or interfaces with greater efficiency.

## 2. How Do I Approach Developing Programs?

**Development Process**  
I prioritize modularity, readability, and incremental testing. For this 3D scene, I organized development into stages, aligning with project milestones:
- **Creating objects**
- **Applying textures**
- **Adding lighting**
- **Enabling camera navigation**

**New Development Strategies**  
While working on interactive camera controls and managing multiple light sources, I developed new strategies. Implementing the Phong shading model was especially rewarding as it enhanced depth and realism in the scene.

**Role of Iteration**  
Iteration played a crucial role. After each milestone, I revisited previous work, refining textures, adjusting lighting, and ensuring smooth camera movement. This process allowed me to identify issues early, resulting in smoother and more polished subsequent phases.

**Evolution in Code Development**  
During the milestones, I concentrated on encapsulating functionality within reusable functions, which enhanced code modularity and readability. This strategy improved organization and made it easier to manage each project component, reinforcing the significance of structured, modular code.

## 3. How Can Computer Science Help Me in Reaching My Goals?

**Educational Pathway**  
Gaining an understanding of computational graphics has expanded my skills in data visualization and interactive design. These abilities will be useful in future educational environments where I might present complex data or create simulations to enhance learning.

**Professional Pathway**  
Skills in computational graphics and visualization are essential in fields like cybersecurity and software development. This project has taught me to think critically about visual elements, user interaction, and efficient coding practices—skills that will support my career goals, particularly in creating responsive and intuitive user interfaces.
